## Sewer Spewer

Sewer Spewer is primarily a client-side single page app that bills itself as the best app for trash talk. Aside from sending rude messages to one another, chatters can enter an image URL to send pngs, gifs and jpgs. Users are identified by whatever name they choose and one of four (_!!!_) random colours. Messages are broadcasted to all users via the WebSockets server! Totally Radicalâ„¢.
